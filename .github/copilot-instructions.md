# Copilot Instructions for MultiDomainPrompts

## Repository Purpose

This repository focuses on advanced prompt engineering, AI automation, and meta-prompting techniques. It provides practical, modular, and reusable prompt templates across multiple domains including software development, content creation, and operational workflows.

## Documentation Standards

### File Structure
- All documentation should be in Markdown format
- Each domain/topic should have its own directory under `docs/`
- Main README files should be comprehensive with clear navigation
- Use relative links for cross-referencing documentation

### Content Organization
- **docs/best-practices/**: General prompt engineering best practices
- **docs/meta-prompts/**: Self-improving prompts and meta-prompt techniques
- **docs/techniques/**: Reusable prompt patterns and techniques
- **docs/automation/**: Domain-specific automation guides
  - `software-development/`: Dev automation templates
  - `content-creation/`: Content generation templates
  - `operations/`: Operational workflow templates

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- Clear, practical, and actionable
- Focus on real-world applications
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Professional yet accessible language

### Formatting Conventions
- Use emoji icons for section headers (üìñ, üéØ, üöÄ, üí°, üõ†Ô∏è, etc.)
- Include code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use bullet points for lists and key features
- Add badges for status indicators where relevant

### Prompt Templates
When creating prompt templates:
- Start with a clear objective statement
- Include context requirements
- Specify expected output format
- Provide examples of usage
- Add notes for customization

### Documentation Structure
Each guide should include:
1. **Overview**: Clear description of purpose
2. **Key Concepts**: Core ideas and terminology
3. **Practical Examples**: Real-world use cases
4. **Templates**: Ready-to-use prompt patterns
5. **Best Practices**: Tips for effective use
6. **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid

## Meta-Prompting Principles

When working on meta-prompts:
- Focus on self-improvement and iteration
- Include clear evaluation criteria
- Design for reusability across domains
- Consider token efficiency
- Document the meta-prompt's evolution process

## Content Creation Guidelines

### Adding New Content
- Ensure content fits within existing structure
- Cross-reference related documents
- Include practical examples
- Test prompts before documenting
- Update main README navigation if adding new sections

### Prompt Quality Standards
- Clarity: Instructions should be unambiguous
- Specificity: Include relevant constraints and requirements
- Context: Provide necessary background information
- Format: Specify output structure clearly
- Flexibility: Allow for appropriate variation while maintaining quality

## Technical Considerations

### Markdown Best Practices
- Use consistent heading levels (# for titles, ## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use code fencing with language specification
- Optimize images and diagrams for documentation
- Ensure links are valid and up-to-date

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word names
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group related files in directories
- Use README.md as the main entry point for each directory

## Contribution Standards

When contributing:
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Update related documentation when making changes
- Ensure examples are tested and working
- Maintain consistency with repository tone and style

## Domain-Specific Notes

### Software Development Automation
- Focus on practical development workflows
- Include code examples in relevant languages
- Address common development pain points
- Consider CI/CD integration scenarios

### Content Creation Automation
- Provide templates for various content types
- Include SEO and optimization considerations
- Address audience targeting
- Cover content repurposing strategies

### Operations Workflows
- Emphasize efficiency and automation
- Include incident response scenarios
- Address compliance and documentation needs
- Consider cross-team collaboration
