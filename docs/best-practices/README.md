## Core Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Specific

**Poor Example:**
```
Write code for a website.
```

**Good Example:**
```
Create a responsive HTML/CSS landing page with:
- Hero section with headline and CTA button
- Features section with 3 columns
- Contact form with name, email, and message fields
- Mobile-first design approach
- Modern, clean aesthetic using a blue/white color scheme
```

### 2. Provide Context

Always give the AI enough background information to understand your needs:

```
Context: I'm building an e-commerce platform for handmade crafts.

Task: Generate product categories that would work well for organizing handmade items.

Requirements:
- 5-7 main categories
- Each with 3-4 subcategories
- Consider customer browsing patterns
- Focus on searchability
```

### 3. Specify Format

Tell the AI exactly how you want the output structured:

```
Generate a project timeline in the following format:

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| [phase name] | [X weeks] | [deliverables] | [dependencies] |

Include 5 phases for launching a mobile app.
```

## Clarity and Specificity

### Use Concrete Examples

Instead of abstract instructions, provide examples:

```
Generate product descriptions following this style:

Example:
"Handcrafted Ceramic Mug - Ocean Blue"
Dive into your morning coffee with this stunning ocean blue ceramic mug. 
Hand-thrown by artisan potters, each piece features unique variations 
that make it one-of-a-kind. Microwave and dishwasher safe. 12oz capacity.

Now create similar descriptions for:
1. Wool scarf
2. Wooden cutting board
3. Silver pendant necklace
```

### Define Constraints

Be explicit about limitations:

```
Write a blog post introduction about AI in healthcare.

Constraints:
- Exactly 150 words
- No medical jargon
- Target audience: general public
- Tone: optimistic but balanced
- Include one compelling statistic
- End with a question to engage readers
```

### Specify Quality Standards

```
Review this code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (highlight any SQL injection risks)
2. Performance issues (O(n²) or worse complexity)
3. Maintainability (functions longer than 50 lines)
4. Best practices violations (magic numbers, global state)

Provide specific line numbers and concrete improvement suggestions.
```

## Context Management

### The Context Window Approach

Structure your prompts to maximize context efficiency:

```
[ROLE]
You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in distributed systems.

[CONTEXT]
We're designing a real-time messaging platform for 100K concurrent users.
Tech stack: Node.js, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker.
Current challenge: Message delivery reliability during network partitions.

[TASK]
Propose three architectural patterns to handle this challenge.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
For each pattern:
- Name
- Pros/Cons
- Implementation complexity (1-10)
- Trade-offs
```

### Progressive Disclosure

For complex tasks, build context progressively:

```
Step 1: "I need to analyze customer churn data."

Step 2: "The dataset has 50K records with demographics, 
         purchase history, and support interactions."

Step 3: "Focus on identifying the top 3 factors correlating 
         with churn in the first 90 days."

Step 4: "Present findings as: hypothesis → data analysis → 
         conclusion → recommended actions."
```

## Output Formatting

### Structured Outputs

#### JSON Format
```
Generate 5 user personas in JSON format:

{
  "personas": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "age": number,
      "occupation": "string",
      "goals": ["string"],
      "pain_points": ["string"],
      "tech_savviness": "low|medium|high"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Markdown Tables
```
Compare these CSS frameworks in a markdown table:
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS
- Bulma

Columns: Learning Curve | Bundle Size | Customization | Community | Best For
```

#### Code Blocks
```
Provide a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers.

Format your response as:
1. Function implementation with docstring
2. Example usage
3. Time/space complexity analysis
4. Potential optimizations

Use proper markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting.
```

## Iteration Strategies

### The Refinement Loop

**Initial Prompt:**
```
Create a marketing email for our new product launch.
```

**Iteration 1:** Add specifics
```
Create a marketing email for our project management software launch.
Target: Small business owners. Tone: Professional but friendly.
```

**Iteration 2:** Add constraints
```
Create a marketing email (max 200 words) for our project management 
software launch. Target: Small business owners managing 5-20 employees.
Highlight: Time-saving features. Include: One clear CTA.
Tone: Professional but friendly.
```

**Iteration 3:** Add structure
```
Create a marketing email for our project management software:

Subject Line: [Attention-grabbing, max 50 chars]

Body Structure:
- Hook (1 sentence - pain point)
- Solution (2-3 sentences - how we solve it)
- Key Benefits (3 bullet points)
- Social Proof (1 statistic or testimonial snippet)
- CTA (Clear, action-oriented)

Total: 200 words max
Target: Small business owners (5-20 employees)
Tone: Professional but friendly
```

### A/B Testing Prompts

Generate variations systematically:

```
Generate 3 versions of a landing page headline for AI-powered analytics:

Version A: Focus on time savings
Version B: Focus on accuracy improvements
Version C: Focus on competitive advantage

Each should be:
- 8-12 words
- Include a number or statistic
- Active voice
- Benefit-driven
```

## Token Optimization

### Be Concise Without Losing Clarity

**Inefficient (300 tokens):**
```
I would like you to please help me write a comprehensive and detailed 
blog post about the many different ways that artificial intelligence 
is being used in modern healthcare settings, including but not limited 
to diagnosis, treatment planning, drug discovery, and patient monitoring...
```

**Efficient (80 tokens):**
```
Write a 1000-word blog post on AI applications in healthcare:
1. Medical diagnosis (imaging, pathology)
2. Treatment planning (precision medicine)
3. Drug discovery (molecule design)
4. Patient monitoring (wearables, predictive alerts)

Tone: Professional yet accessible
Target: Healthcare administrators
Include: 2-3 real-world examples per section
```

### Reuse Context

Instead of repeating context:

```
[Initial prompt with full context]
...

[Follow-up]
"Based on the above context, now generate X"
"Using the same parameters, create Y"
"Apply this approach to Z"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Guide the AI through reasoning steps:

```
Analyze whether our startup should raise VC funding or bootstrap.

Think through this step-by-step:
1. List our current runway and burn rate
2. Identify growth opportunities requiring capital
3. Evaluate dilution vs. growth trade-off
4. Consider market timing and competition
5. Assess team's ability to execute under different scenarios
6. Make a recommendation with supporting rationale

Show your reasoning for each step.
```

### Role-Based Prompting

```
[ROLE: Senior DevOps Engineer]
Review this CI/CD pipeline configuration for:
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- Cost efficiency
- Disaster recovery readiness

Provide recommendations as you would to a junior team member.
```

### Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to establish patterns:

```
Convert these requirements into user stories:

Example 1:
Requirement: Users need to reset passwords
User Story: As a user, I want to reset my password via email so that 
I can regain access if I forget my credentials.

Example 2:
Requirement: Admins need to export user data
User Story: As an admin, I want to export user data to CSV so that 
I can analyze trends in external tools.

Now convert:
1. Users need to filter search results
2. Users need to save favorite items
3. Admins need to manage user permissions
```

### Negative Prompting

Specify what to avoid:

```
Write a technical blog post about microservices architecture.

Include:
- Real-world use cases
- Practical implementation advice
- Trade-offs and challenges

Avoid:
- Overly theoretical discussions
- Buzzword-heavy language
- Vendor-specific solutions
- Claim that microservices solve all problems
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Vague Instructions
```
Make this better.
```

### ✅ Specific Improvements
```
Improve this paragraph by:
1. Reducing wordiness (target: 30% shorter)
2. Using active voice
3. Adding a concrete example
4. Simplifying technical terms for general audience
```

### ❌ Assuming Knowledge
```
Fix the bug in my code.
```

### ✅ Providing Context
```
This Python function throws IndexError when the list is empty.
[paste code]
Expected behavior: Return None for empty lists.
Current behavior: Crashes with IndexError.
Please fix and explain the solution.
```

### ❌ Multiple Unrelated Tasks
```
Write a blog post, design a logo, and create a marketing strategy.
```

### ✅ Focused Single Task
```
Write a 500-word blog post introducing our rebranding initiative.
[Details about rebrand...]
```
